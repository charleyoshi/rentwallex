                A cookie is a small text file stored in a dedicated location on your computer, mobile device, tablet or other device when you use your browser to visit an online service. Web beacons are tiny images we may place on our web pages or e-mails. They can be used, for example, to anonymously obtain the number of times an Internet user has visited a particular page or whether an e-mail has been read. As their name suggests, web beacons are invisible, and any part of our Sites, including the advertising messages displayed on them, may contain web beacons. Unlike cookies, web beacons are not placed on your computer. Other tracking technologies, like web beacons, may be used for similar purposes. In this Policy, all such tracking technologies are collectively called "Cookie(s)." Any Personal Information collected using Cookies by or on behalf of Rentwallex (if applicable) is treated with the same level of confidentiality as any other Personal Information held by Rentwallex.
